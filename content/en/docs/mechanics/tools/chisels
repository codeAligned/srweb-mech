Chisels
==========
A chisel is used to cut or carve materials, usually wood. A chisel is forced
into the material using a hammer or mallet.

Chisels are useful for cutting sections out of wood to make indented sections.

Aside from generic woodworking chisels, there are many types available for much
more specialised uses.
