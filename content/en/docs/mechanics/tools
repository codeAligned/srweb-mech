Drill bits
----------
Drill bits are cutting tools that fit into the end of a drill and are generally
used to make holes in things. There are quite a few types of drill bits you
might want to be aware of.

### Twist drill bit ###
This is the most common type of drill bit, and what people normally think of
when they think of drill bits.

Commonly-available twist drill bits have geometry that is suitable for most
materials you're likely to want to drill thorough, but not specifically
optimised for any of them.

These drill bits tend to wander unless a groove for them to rest in is already
defined - for this purpose, a centre punch may be used.

A lip and spur drill bit is a variation of a twist bit more suitable for
drilling wood. It helps prevent the drill bit from wandering without having to
use a centre punch. It visually looks similar to a twist bit but has a clear
spike on the end.

### Hole saw ###
This is a drill bit used to make larger holes in most material that isn't too
thick. It consists of saw teeth around a ring to cut the large hole, and a
pilot twist drill bit in the centre to keep the drill bit steady.

Its advantage over twist and wood spade drill bits (below) is that it needs to
cut only around the edge of the hole, making it a lot faster and neater for
larger holes, and holes at sizes which would be impossible to do at all with
wood spade or twist drill bits.

However, the depth of the hole is limited to the physical depth of the
cylinder.

### Wood spade drill bit ###
This is a drill bit more common than hole saw and also used to cut larger
holes, but specifically in wood. It is more commonly-found than a hole saw.
They are flat with a point in the centre and cutting edges on either side.

However, unlike hole saws, these drill bits must cut all the material, and so
take longer and require more power for larger holes. Past a certain size this
makes them essentially unusable, so these are not commonly available for as
large hole sizes as hole saws. They also very frequently cause splintering so
are not suitable if a completely clean cut is required.

Chisels
-------
A chisel is used to cut or carve materials, usually wood. A chisel is forced
into the material using a hammer or mallet.

Chisels are useful for cutting sections out of wood to make indented sections.

Aside from generic woodworking chisels, there are many types available for much
more specialised uses.
