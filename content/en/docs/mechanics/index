Designing and building your robot
=================================

Robot design is a complicated task. These four overviews will tell you about
the important points to keep in mind when designing and building your robot.

* [Tools](/docs/mechanics/tools)
* [Materials and parts](/docs/mechanics/materials)
* [Joints and connections](/docs/mechanics/joints)
* [Design considerations](/docs/mechanics/design%20considerations)

In addition to these, we have also developed short "how to"-style documents to
explain specific topics we find teams sometimes have difficulty with. These are
linked to in the overviews above.

Robot base designs
==================

In order to help teams get started with their robot faster, we have documented
three sample designs for different styles of robot base. These do not have to
be used - we always welcome innovative designs - but reading them can
help you to understand some of the decisions you will need to make when
designing your robot, and as such they are recommended for all teams, even
those with no intention of building to these designs.

These designs are documented in
[the tutorial section](/docs/tutorials/robot%20bases).
