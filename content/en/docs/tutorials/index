Tutorials
=========

We've written a [walkthrough](/docs/tutorials/walkthrough) to guide you through &mdash; step-by-step &mdash; the process of writing, transfering and running code on your kit. It's a good place to start if you're not sure what you're doing. **After** that, you might like to read the following tutorials listed in order of difficulty:

1. [(The Walkthrough)](/docs/tutorials/walkthrough) &mdash; you should start here
2. [Basic Motor Control](/docs/tutorials/basic_motor_control) &mdash; all you need to know to get your motors moving

[Robot bases](/docs/tutorials/robot%20bases)
--------------------------------------------

We have written tutorials on how to build three different robot bases. They do not have to be followed, but they provide a useful starting point onto which to build, and also help explain design decisions that need to be made in the designing of a robot base.
