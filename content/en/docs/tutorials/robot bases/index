Robot bases
===========

We have written tutorials on how to build three different robot bases. They do not have to be followed, but they provide a useful starting point onto which to build, and also help explain design decisions that need to be made in the designing of a robot base.

1. [Anne de Breuil](/docs/tutorials/robot%20bases/Anne_de_Breuil) - A small robot with two motors in the middle and castors on the ends. It is an octagonal prism in shape, with two flat levels on which to mount kit.
2. [Lady Clarick](/docs/tutorials/robot%20bases/Lady_Clarick) - A large robot with two motors at the rear and two castors at the front. It is roughly cuboid in shape, with two flat levels on which to mount kit.
3. [Charlotte Backson](/docs/tutorials/robot%20bases/Charlotte_Backson) - A small robot with four wheel drive and a significant level of insanity - A small robot with four wheel drive and a significant level of insanity.
